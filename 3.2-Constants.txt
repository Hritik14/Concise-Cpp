					Constants
					__________

A constant is a value which never changes.
2 is always equal to 2, it never changes, it is a constant. Same is the case with 'a' or 4.12 or 3.14

Constants can be integers, characters or floating point numbers (decimal numbers). 

It is interesting to think why the language requires to put ' (singal quote) before and after a character constant.
Because the representation of a character may be of more than one character.
Can you find a way to store the value <Enter> in the program? What about inserting a tab character ?
Different Operating systems handle both the character in different ways so you just cannot press it from your keyboard to store them.
Instead there are characters defined to store them.
They are '\n' for newline or <Enter>
and 
'\t' for tab character.

Note that there is a backslash (the one near your enter button) not a forward slash.

All these are singal characters:
'\a' , '\b' ,'\n' , '\t' and many more.
Try exprimenting with them by printing them.





Sometimes we need to turn a variable into a constant. There is a way for that.
Suppose we want to have a constant named PI which will hold the value 3.14
for that we have an access modifier named const.
Prefixing the word const before the declaration of a variable makes it constant.

So,
	const int P = 3;
	const float PI = 3.14;
	const char TRADEMARK = 'H';

are constants and you cannot change their values. Just like you cannot change the value of 2 or 3 you cannot change the values of constants declared.
