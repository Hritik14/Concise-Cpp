					INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING IN C++ [PART 1]

A little bit about C++ and this book.
_____________________________________

First of all, C++ is NOT advanced C. The two are different programming languages. C++ was originally developed by Bjarne Stroustroupe at bell labs ... [insert more info here from Bjarne website]
In this book, as advised by CBSE, we will be following the C++ that was popular in 1990s. The student is advised not to panic. Although the language has changed a lot but
essentials have remained the same. The book takes you to the journey of programming, bit by bit, revealing all the interesting aspects.
The book has been strictly based on CBSE syllabus found at http://cbse.nic.in but if the reader wishes to dwell more and learn the advanced concepts which are beyond the scope of this book then he/she is advised to take a look at 'The C++ Programming Language' By Bjarne Stroustroupe, [Insert more good books' name here]
The book aims to guide the reader to both enjoy the language and get the marks he/she deserves in the examination.

C++ is a case-sensitive language i.e. it is sensitive to the case of the letters (case as in upper-case (Capital letters) and lower-case(Small letters)).
So, Manu,manu,MaNu,MaNU are 4 different persons in C++.

C++ does not care about the space between any two keywords [Keywords are words which are the real instructions TODO: Put more about keywords and differentiate between string and keyword here]. That is, you write one word and then hit enter 10 times or 1 time or hit a space then write another word, the language does not care.
